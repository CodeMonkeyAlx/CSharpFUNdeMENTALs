# CSharpFUNdeMENTALs
 Hi howdy yes... Thanks for tuning in! Its Yah boi CodeMonkeyAlx here hanging out with the C# Code.
 Alright, jokes aside... This is seriously just a simple repo for me to keep my "Learning experiance" online. 
 If I do at some point manage to make a legit application using C# or unity. 
 I'll either post it here or on itch.io respectively based on what platform I am using at the time.
 Kay bye, 
 Alex
